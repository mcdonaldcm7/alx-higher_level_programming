## About
A project oriented around scripting with js and using the *request* module to
make request as well using *APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)* to make
request. By the end of this project I should be able to explain to anyone,
**without the help of Google:**

- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to manipulate JSON data
- How to use request and fetch API
- How to read and write a file using fs module
